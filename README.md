## Spades (Play vs CPUs)

Open `index.html` in a modern browser (double-click or right-click -> Open with). The game is a single-file webpage where you are South and play against three CPU opponents (West, North, East).

How to play:
- At the start of each round, select your bid from the dropdown and click "Submit Bid".
- After bids are revealed, play proceeds with you (South) leading. Click a card in your hand to play it.
- CPUs use simple heuristics: they follow suit when possible and use spades to trump.
- Scoring: normal spades-lite scoring (10 points per bid trick, penalties for failing, and a simple nil score).

If you want to develop locally, you can serve the folder with a static server or simply open the file directly. Node.js is not required to play.
